## State & Data Management

### Zustand

**What is this?**  
A minimal state management library.

- Easier than Redux.

## Advanced Architectures

### Local First / Offline First

**What is this?**  
Applications that work offline and sync later.

- **ElectricSQL** → Sync engine for databases. 📖 [Docs](https://electric-sql.com/docs/intro)
- **Zero Framework** → Full-stack offline-first solution. 📖 [Docs](https://zero.sh/docs)
- **TanStack DB** → Local-first database for front-end. 📖 [Docs](https://tanstack.com/db/latest/docs/overview)

## Design & Productivity

### Design Engineer Role

**What is this?**  
A developer who bridges UI design and code.

- Tools like Cursor (Design Mode) and Figma Dev Mode integrate design directly into coding.
- AI boosts code quality, design productivity, and testing automation.
